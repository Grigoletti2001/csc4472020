/* INSTRUCTIONS
 *
 * Complete the exercises below.  For each "EXERCISE" comment, add
 * code immediately below the comment.
 *
 * Please see README.md for instructions, including compilation and testing.
 * 
 * GRADING
 * 
 * 1. Submissions MUST compile using SBT with UNCHANGED configuration and tests with no
 *    compilation errors.  Submissions with compilation errors will receive 0 points.
 *    Note that refactoring the code will cause the tests to fail.
 *
 * 2. You MUST NOT edit the SBT configuration and tests.  Altering it in your submission will
 *    result in 0 points for this assignment.
 *
 * 3. You MUST NOT use while loops or (re)assignment to variables (you can use "val" declarations,
 *    but not "var" declarations).  You must use recursion instead.
 *
 * 4. You may declare auxiliary functions if you like.
 *
 * SUBMISSION
 *
 * 1. Submit this file on D2L before the deadline.
 *
 * 2. Late submissions will not be permitted because solutions will be discussed in class.

  // EXERCISE 1: complete the following function.
  // It has two parameters: 
  // - i18n : (a reference to) an instance of a class that extends / implements the Internationalization trait (interface) defined above.
  // - name : a String
  // You should use the "greet" method of "i18n" to find a greeting for "name".  Return the result.
  def useGreet (i18n : Internationalization, name : String) : String = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.

  // EXERCISE 2: complete the following function.
  // It should return an instance of a class that extends / implements the Internationalization trait (interface) defined above.
  // The "greet" method should return a String consisting of "Hello", a space, and the name given as an argument.
  // You can either define classes inside the newEnglish method or directly inside the "dynamic" object.

  // EXERCISE 3: complete the following function.
  // It should return an instance of a class that extends / implements the Internationalization trait (interface) defined above.
  // The "greet" method should return a String consisting of "Bonjour", a space, and the name given as an argument.
  // You can either define classes inside the newFrench method or directly inside the "dynamic" object.
