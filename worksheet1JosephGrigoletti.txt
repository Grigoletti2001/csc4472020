  3.4.1 For Linux and OS X, run env or env | sort in a terminal. The latter form sorts the output by variable name. For example:
    $ env | sort

Note: The $ character is the standard last character in prompts for shell programs. 
You should not type the $; just the env | sort

prints the lines of its input or concatenation of all files listed in its argument 
list in sorted order.  sort -r reverses order. 

env is a shell command for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. 
It is used to either print a list of environment variables or run another 
utility in an altered environment without having to modify the currently existing 
environment. Using env, variables may be added or removed, and existing variables 
may be changed by assigning new values to them.

In practice, env has another common use. It is often used by shell scripts
 to launch the correct interpreter. In this usage, the environment is typically not changed.

What are env. vars?  
 Simply put, environment variables are variables that are set up in your shell when you log in. 
 They are called “environment variables” because most of them affect the way your Unix shell works 
 for you. One points to your home directory and another to your history file

Some environment variables are set up in system files like /etc/profile that are read 
before your local setup files when you log in.

Environment variables can be changed or unset, but they can also be augmented.
 If your search path is set up in /etc/profile, you can redefine it in your local .profile or 
 add to it with a command like this:
