Introduction Email: 
Hello.  I'm writing because you are enrolled in CSC447 for Fall.  

Welcome!

We will be entirely online this quarter, using a mix of Youtube, 
Zoom, Discord and D2L to communicate.  Our first Zoom meeting 
will be next Wednesday.  The class is now activated on D2L.

To make sure you are prepared for next week, I've made 
a 28 minute introduction to the class.  In it, I will introduce the
 format of the class and walk through the syllabus.  Please watch 
 this video as soon as is convenient: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4H0hru5X0

There are some additional things to look over before next Wednesday. 
 Watch the video for more details.

Looking forward to meeting you!

Best wishes,

James

LEARNING GOALS
Learn PLs more easily by recognizing concepts
"it has while loops"
"it has closures"
"it has list comprehensions"
"it has dynamic dispatch using vtables"
"it has mixins"

Instead, become familiar with a range of tools and build systems
